A minimalistic REST API built in PHP. I noticed that nodejs is the go to technology/language to build a simple API. So i started this project as a way of finding out if PHP can be a great tool of bootstrapping a REST API. This project is built on top of [WaterPipe](https://github.com/ElementaryFramework/WaterPipe), a routing framework and request and reponse handler for PHP.
No authentication/authorization or any type of Access control has been implemented.
